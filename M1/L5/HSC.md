**Hardware and Software Components**

Hardware and software components form essential parts of an IT infrastructure, making their understanding vital to successful IT support professionals. Let's examine each element more closely here:

**Hardware Components of IT Support:**

***Computers:***

At the core of IT infrastructures lies computers. From desktops and laptops, to servers and servers. Computers process data, run software applications and serve as interfaces that allow users to interact with their system.

***Servers:***

Servers are special computers designed to serve applications over a network and connect other devices or apps with them. Servers come in various forms - file servers, website servers, database servers or application servers are among some examples - with more processing power, storage capacity and reliability than regular computers.

***Network Equipment:***

Network equipment typically comprises routers, switches, hubs and network cables. Routers connect different networks together while also facilitating data transmission; switches enable multiple devices to join one network at once for efficient exchange; hubs connect several devices at low speed but provide connectivity; while network cables such as Ethernet provide wired links between devices.

***Peripherals:***

Peripherals refers to input/output devices connected with computers such as keyboards, mice, monitors, printers, scanners and speakers which allow users to interact and complete various tasks on the system. Examples may include keyboards, mice, monitors, printers , scanners , speakers etc.
