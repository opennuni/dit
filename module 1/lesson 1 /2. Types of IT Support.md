They also serve as first line assistance while troubleshooting issues before escalating them as necessary to specialised teams if required.

***On-Site Support***

This kind of support involves physically visiting a user's location to address technical problems that cannot be managed remotely, such as hardware repairs, software installations, network troubleshooting or system upgrades.
